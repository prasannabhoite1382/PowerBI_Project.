# PowerBI_Project.

This project involves creating an interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for a fictional ecommerce platform, Madhav Ecommerce. The dashboard is built from two raw tables: Orders and Details. It provides insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
